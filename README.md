Lets students create and select groups. Features:

* Students can select and join groups
* Non-editing teachers may be assigned to groups
* Teacher can export course group list as a csv-file
* Full compatibility with basic Moodle groups: groups may be created by other means if needed, supports group assignment submissions etc.
